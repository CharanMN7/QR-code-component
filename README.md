## My process

I started off setting up the fonts. For this, instead of importing it from the provided URL, I used the `@font-face` property to use the provided fonts in my solution. Just wanted to flex my CSS muscle a little bit ðŸ˜….
After that, I wrote the HTML to set up the layout. Later I wrote the CSS. It was easy, nothing more than centering some containers and coloring elements. And! put some `box-shadows` too.
Lastly, adjusted the attribution part, a little, to put it at the bottom of the page.

### Built with

- Basic HTML & CSS
- Custom font imported using the `@font-face` CSS property.

### What I learned
This challenge gave me a clarity about what I should be spending my time on while working on a frontend project like this. Start with laying the foundations and do not worry about what might happen to the design already. Always stick to the step-by-step approach. First the layout (HTML) and later, the styling (CSS).
